Recently my GitHub Actions pipeline was failing because of a test:

```text
1) Users can delete comments if the post belongs to them
  Failure/Error: find("#delete-#{comment.id}").click

  Capybara::Ambiguous:
    Ambiguous match, found 2 elements matching visible css "#delete-3"
```

The failing test was checking that users could delete comments on their posts:

```ruby
RSpec.feature "Users can delete comments", type: :feature do
  let(:alice) { FactoryBot.create(:user) }
  let(:bob) { FactoryBot.create(:user) }

  let!(:post) { FactoryBot.create(:post, author: alice) }
  let!(:comment) { FactoryBot.create(:comment, body: "Great post!", author: bob, post: post) }

  # ...

  scenario "if the post belongs to them", js: true do
    login_as(alice)
    visit post_path(post)

    expect(page).to have_content("Great post!")

    accept_confirm do
      find("#delete-#{comment.id}").click
    end

    expect(page).to_not have_content("Great post!")
  end
```

But this same test was green when I ran it locally. 

I decided to drop a `save_and_open_page` in there to see what was going on. `save_and_open_page` is a Capybara method that saves a snapshot of a page so you can open it in the browser and see what Capybara sees.

Capybara was telling me there were two of those trash can buttons on the page with the same ID. But the ones I was looking at definitely had distinct IDs, one was `#delete-627`, the other was `#delete-78`...

That's when I realized that buttons for deleting comments and buttons for deleting posts probably shouldn't have the same ID format: if a comment and a post happened to have the same ID in the database and also appear on the same page it would lead to exactly the kind of ambiguous match Capybara was reporting. 

>This is somewhat confusing. I'm talking about two different kinds of "ID". One is the CSS ID of the button elements on the page. The other is the IDs of the post and comment records in the database.

I wanted to take a look at the version of that Capybara snapshot being generated in the CI environment to make sure that's what was happening. The only problem is that CI jobs run in containers and containers are ephemeral; once a job has run everything disappears into the void. 

If you want to snatch files or directories from the jaws of the void you need to create what they call an [artifact](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts). Luckily there's an official [upload-artifact GitHub Action](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) for doing exactly this. Here's all I had to add to my `.github/workflows/tests.yml` file:

```yaml
    - name: Upload Capybara snapshots
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      if: failure()
      with:
        name: capybara
        path: tmp/capybara/
``` 

This allowed me to download an archive of the `tmp/capybara` directory as it was during CI. (The `if: failure()` part is important: without it the workflow will never get as far as this step because the failing test prevents it.)

So I ran the pipeline, downloaded the snapshot artifact and imagine my shock when I discovered two buttons with the ID `#delete-3`, one for deleting a comment and another for deleting a post.

But why was the test passing in one environment and not the other? I think something about the way IDs are assigned to factories by FactoryBot. 

In the CI environment the post and comment causing the trouble were consistently being given the ID 3 every time. Meanwhile on my computer the IDs were being incremented across each test, i.e.: the first time the tests ran the post or comment ID would be 1, the next time it would be 2 and so on. This wasn't happening in the CI environment because each container starts from scratch with a fresh database.

I'd started running my tests for posts long before I ever had tests for comments so their IDs were out of sync, with comments up to 78 and posts already in the 600s. It wasn't until I ran the tests in CI that I ran into this situation of comments and posts with the same ID on the same page.

I fixed this by installing [DatabaseCleaner](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner) which got my factory IDs starting from 1 each time, and I finally had the tests failing the same way in both environments. To make them pass I changed the CSS IDs for the comment deletion buttons to look like `#delete-comment-1` to differentiate them from the ones for posts.
