I recently started [CS Primer](https://csprimer.com/), "a self-paced platform for software engineers to learn the CS foundations they need, from computer architecture to distributed systems".

CS Primer is run by [Oz Nova](https://ozwrites.com/), who also created [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).

As it says on the Teach Yourself CS website:

>If youâ€™re a self-taught engineer or bootcamp grad, you owe it to yourself to learn computer science. 

That's basically why I decided to start CS Primer as well. I've been working as a dev for 3 years now and I'd like to start filling in all the gaps I left when I was teaching myself software development.

I've started with the algorithms and data structures course since this type of technical interview is so common. And I'm also going to try and blog about it.
